GITHUB DISCLAIMER
As no empty folders can be stored in the github repository, I pre-populated the "monsters/" directory. 
I recommend to empty this folder before starting the game, so that you get your own randomly generated Unlichtwesen at the start of the game.

DISCLAIMER

Full credit and props to libtcod and the python tutorial code, it is the basis of this and more or less still visible. Licenses for libtcodpy and Bearlibterminal are as indicated in the files. 

This is code writte by a hobbyist. I am not a programmer by education, and this code is not distributed commercially. Although I write and use this code on my machine without any known issues, download and execution is at your own risk.
